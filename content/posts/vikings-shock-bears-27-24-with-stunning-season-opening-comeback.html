  <!-- Intro -->
  <p class="layout-desc">
    In a thrilling season opener at Soldier Field, the <strong>Minnesota Vikings</strong> overcame a 17–6
    deficit to defeat the <strong>Chicago Bears</strong> <strong>27–24</strong>, setting the tone for
    a compelling 2025 NFL season. The matchup, filled with high drama, strategic maneuvers, and individual
    heroics, showcased the resilience of the Vikings and the potential of rookie quarterback
    <strong>J.J. McCarthy</strong>, who orchestrated a historic fourth-quarter comeback. From kickoff
    to the final whistle, the game was a masterclass in momentum swings, coaching adjustments, and clutch play.
  </p>

  <!-- Section 1: Bears Start Strong -->
  <h3 class="layout-title">Chicago Controls the First Half</h3>
  <p>
    The Bears, led by rookie quarterback <strong>Caleb Williams</strong>, took early command, powered by a
    sold-out Soldier Field crowd. Williams mixed short passes with designed runs, keeping Minnesota’s
    defense guessing. On the opening drive, he found <strong>Rome Odunze</strong> for 13 yards before
    capping the march with a rushing touchdown for a 7–0 lead.

  <p>
    Chicago’s defense fed off the momentum. Cornerback <strong>Nahshon Wright</strong> intercepted McCarthy
    deep in Vikings territory and returned it 74 yards for a touchdown, igniting Soldier Field and extending
    the Bears’ advantage. Anchored by veteran pass rushers, Chicago’s defensive front kept McCarthy under siege,
    forcing hurried throws and stifling rhythm. At halftime, the Bears led <strong>17–6</strong> and looked
    firmly in control.
  </p>

  <!-- Section 2: Vikings Adjust -->
  <h3 class="layout-title">Minnesota Adjusts After Halftime</h3>
  <p>
    Despite the deficit, the Vikings showed flashes. <strong>Aaron Jones</strong> broke off key runs, and
    <strong>Justin Jefferson</strong> made clutch third-down grabs, though Chicago’s alternating coverages
    kept them out of the end zone. After halftime, offensive coordinator <strong>Kevin O’Connell</strong>
    emphasized a quicker passing game to neutralize the Bears’ rush. McCarthy settled in, hitting Jefferson
    and <strong>T.J. Hockenson</strong> with short strikes to move the chains. Defensively, Minnesota deployed
    zone blitzes to pressure Williams, disrupting Chicago’s rhythm.

  <p>
    Chicago tried to respond with balance, but miscues mounted: a broken-up deep shot to Odunze and a failed
    fourth-down conversion at the Vikings’ 30 halted momentum. Head coach <strong>Ben Johnson</strong>
    grew visibly frustrated as the Vikings’ adjustments chipped away at the Bears’ control.
  </p>

  <!-- Section 3: Fourth Quarter Comeback -->
  <h3 class="layout-title">McCarthy Leads Historic Fourth Quarter</h3>
  <p>
    Trailing 17–6 entering the fourth, Minnesota needed a spark. McCarthy delivered with poise, engineering a
    drive capped by a 13-yard touchdown to Jefferson. Soon after, he connected with Aaron Jones for a
    <strong>27-yard touchdown</strong>, displaying timing and field vision. McCarthy then added a
    <strong>14-yard rushing touchdown</strong>, giving Minnesota a 27–17 lead and capping a remarkable
    rally.
  </p>
  <p>
    Chicago mounted a late push, with Odunze hauling in a 25-yard reception to set up a 1-yard Williams-to-Odunze
    score, cutting it to 27–24. But Minnesota’s defense held firm—tight coverage, timely sacks, and a crucial
    third-down drop by Chicago sealed the win for the Vikings.

  <h3 class="layout-title">Tactical and Coaching Takeaways</h3>
  <p>
    Chicago’s early formula—balance, strong protection, and opportunism—cracked under Minnesota’s
    adjustments. The Bears faltered on third downs and clock management late, while the Vikings exploited
    mismatches. McCarthy’s reads, throws, and athleticism under pressure flipped the script. Minnesota’s
    coaches dialed up blitzes, varied coverages, and offensive tempo shifts; Chicago’s staff struggled to
    counter, exposing decision-making gaps.
