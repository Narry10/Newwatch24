  <!-- Intro -->
  <p class="layout-desc">
    The 2025 NFL season kicked off at Lumen Field with a tense NFC West clash as the
    <strong>San Francisco 49ers</strong> edged out the <strong>Seattle Seahawks</strong>
    <strong>17–13</strong> in a contest defined by defensive intensity, timely offensive
    execution, and a dramatic late-game finish. Quarterback <strong>Brock Purdy</strong>
    orchestrated a game-winning drive while the 49ers’ defense stifled Seattle’s comeback
    hopes. The Seahawks, led by <strong>Sam Darnold</strong> and rookie back
    <strong>Zach Charbonnet</strong>, showed flashes of promise but could not overcome
    San Francisco’s disciplined game management and defensive resilience.
  </p>

  <!-- Section 1: Seattle strikes -->
  <h3 class="layout-title">Seattle Strikes First</h3>
  <p>
    Both defenses dominated early, producing a scoreless first quarter. Seattle broke through
    in the second with a <strong>48-yard field goal</strong> by <strong>Jason Myers</strong>
    for a 3–0 lead. Later, Charbonnet capped a steady drive with a
    <strong>1-yard touchdown run</strong>, extending the lead to <strong>10–0</strong> and
    igniting the Lumen Field crowd. Behind solid blocking, Darnold mixed short throws with
    scrambles, keeping the 49ers guessing.

  <!-- Section 2: 49ers respond -->
  <h3 class="layout-title">49ers Counter</h3>
  <p>
    San Francisco answered with a measured drive, balancing runs and quick throws. Purdy
    found <strong>George Kittle</strong> for a <strong>5-yard touchdown</strong>, trimming
    the deficit to 10–7. The moment was bittersweet, as Kittle strained his hamstring on
    the drive, an injury that would sideline him long-term and challenge the 49ers’ depth.
  </p>

  <!-- Section 3: Second-half adjustments -->
  <h3 class="layout-title">Halftime Adjustments</h3>
  <p>
    In the second half, Purdy leaned on quicker passes, with <strong>Ricky Pearsall</strong>
    emerging as a key target on intermediate routes. Seattle countered with blitzes and
    tight coverage, forcing Purdy into pressure throws. Defensively, San Francisco struck
    a turning point when <strong>Nick Bosa</strong> strip-sacked Darnold and recovered the
    ball, halting a promising Seattle drive.
  </p>

  <!-- Section 4: Purdy’s game-winner -->
  <h3 class="layout-title">Purdy Delivers Late</h3>
  <p>
    Trailing 13–10 in the fourth, Purdy orchestrated a <strong>9-play, 62-yard drive</strong>.
    A clutch 15-yard third-down strike to Pearsall set up the decisive moment. With 1:34 left,
    Purdy connected with <strong>Jake Tonges</strong> for a <strong>6-yard touchdown</strong>,
    putting the 49ers up <strong>17–13</strong>. Seattle’s last push faltered under relentless
    pressure from <strong>Dre Greenlaw</strong> and the front, sealing the win.

  <!-- Section 5: Special teams drama -->
  <h3 class="layout-title">Special Teams Drama</h3>
  <p>
    Special teams shaped the story. 49ers kicker <strong>Jake Moody</strong> missed a
    27-yard attempt and had another blocked, prompting his release after the game.
    San Francisco signed <strong>Eddy Pineiro</strong> as his replacement. Meanwhile,
    Seattle’s Myers was steady, hitting both attempts, including a 37-yarder in the
    fourth to cut the lead to 17–13.
  </p>

  <!-- Section 6: Tactical & coaching notes -->
  <h3 class="layout-title">Tactical Takeaways</h3>
  <p>
    Seattle thrived early with a balanced run-pass mix and defensive pressure but failed
    to adjust to San Francisco’s mid-game schemes. The 49ers showed resilience and
    adaptability, using tempo shifts and defensive execution to reverse momentum.
    Coaching decisions were clear: San Francisco emphasized situational awareness and
    personnel rotation, while Seattle struggled to sustain answers.

  <!-- Section 9: What It Means -->
  <h3 class="layout-title">What It Means</h3>
  <p>
    San Francisco’s resilience and depth provide confidence and momentum for the
    weeks ahead, even with Kittle sidelined. Seattle must refine situational execution
    and defensive consistency to contend in the NFC West. Both teams will carry lessons
    from this tightly contested opener into the rest of the season.

      <strong>Bottom line:</strong> The 49ers’ 17–13 win in Seattle highlighted strategy,
      toughness, and clutch execution. Purdy’s late heroics and Bosa’s defensive impact
      sealed a classic NFC West opener, setting the tone for a dramatic divisional race.
