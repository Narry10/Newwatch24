  <!-- Intro -->
  <p class="layout-desc">
    The 2025 NFL season opened with a hard-fought NFC showdown at the Caesars Superdome as the
    <strong>Arizona Cardinals</strong> overcame the <strong>New Orleans Saints</strong> <strong>20–13</strong>
    in a contest defined by resilience, strategic adjustments, and a dramatic late-game finish.
    Quarterback <strong>Kyler Murray</strong>, battling illness, orchestrated the game-winning drive,
    while Arizona’s defense delivered clutch stops. The Saints, led by <strong>Spencer Rattler</strong>
    and <strong>Alvin Kamara</strong>, flashed promise but faltered against Arizona’s discipline.
  </p>

  <!-- Section: Slow start -->
  <h3 class="layout-title">Defense Dominates Early</h3>
  <p>
    The first quarter was a defensive standoff, with both teams trading punts. Early in the second,
    <strong>Jason Myers</strong> gave New Orleans a 3–0 lead with a 42-yard field goal. Arizona answered
    late in the half as Murray hit <strong>Michael Wilson</strong> for a 12-yard touchdown, pushing the
    Cardinals ahead <strong>7–3</strong>. Despite illness, Murray remained composed, delivering accurate
    throws against New Orleans’ aggressive secondary.

  <!-- Section: Cardinals adjustments -->
  <h3 class="layout-title">Cardinals Adjust, Extend Lead</h3>
  <p>
    After halftime, Arizona leaned on high-percentage throws to offset the Saints’ pass rush. Rookie
    tight end <strong>Will Johnson</strong> snagged a 5-yard touchdown from Murray, making it
    <strong>14–3</strong>. New Orleans countered with Kamara’s runs and Rattler’s mobility, but
    penalties and stalled third downs undermined progress.

  <!-- Section: Defense -->
  <h3 class="layout-title">Defense Defines the Game</h3>
  <p>
    Linebacker <strong>Josh Sweat</strong> registered four pressures, forcing hurried throws. Rookie
    corner Will Johnson locked down deep options, contributing to an interception that set up prime
    field position. While the Saints’ front sacked Murray five times, missed tackles and red-zone
    lapses kept Arizona ahead.
  </p>

  <!-- Section: Saints’ late push -->
  <h3 class="layout-title">Saints Rally Late</h3>
  <p>
    In the fourth, Rattler led a 10-play, 68-yard march capped by a 6-yard touchdown to
    <strong>Chris Olave</strong>, cutting it to 20–13. With momentum shifting, Arizona stayed calm.
    Murray converted two critical third downs, mixing short throws with <strong>Zach Charbonnet</strong>’s
    runs to drain the clock and secure the win.
  </p>

  <!-- Section: Special Teams -->
  <h3 class="layout-title">Special Teams Impact</h3>
  <p>
    Kicker <strong>Eddy Pineiro</strong> was perfect, hitting both field goals. Myers scored all of
    New Orleans’ points (three FGs), but Arizona’s coverage units controlled field position late,
    limiting comeback chances.
  </p>

  <!-- Section: Tactical Takeaways -->
  <h3 class="layout-title">Tactical Takeaways</h3>
  <p>
    The Saints opened with tempo and aggressive rush, but adjustments lagged. Arizona adapted with
    quick passes, clock management, and defensive rotations. Coaching fingerprints were clear:
    the Cardinals rotated personnel and emphasized matchups, while New Orleans failed to counter
    in crunch time.

  <!-- Section: Stats -->
  <h3 class="layout-title">Stat Leaders</h3>
  <ul class="layout-stats">
    <li><strong>Kyler Murray:</strong> 20/30, 245 YDS, 2 TD</li>
    <li><strong>Michael Wilson:</strong> 6 REC, 78 YDS, 1 TD</li>
    <li><strong>Will Johnson:</strong> 1 REC, 5 YDS, 1 TD</li>

  </ul>

  <!-- Section: Intangibles -->
  <h3 class="layout-title">Beyond the Numbers</h3>
  <p>
    Non-stat elements shaped the game: Murray’s poise despite illness, sideline communication,
    audibles, and motivational gestures. Crowd energy at the Superdome amplified intensity,
    especially during Arizona’s clock-killing drive.
  </p>

  <!-- Outro -->
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <strong>Bottom line:</strong> Arizona’s 20–13 victory over New Orleans highlighted strategy,
      toughness, and individual brilliance. Murray’s resilience, supported by a disciplined defense,
      provided the blueprint. For New Orleans, the loss underscored red-zone lapses and execution gaps.
      Both teams leave Week 1 with lessons that will shape their seasons.
    </p>
