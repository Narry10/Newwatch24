  <!-- Intro -->
  <p class="layout-desc">
    When the news of Robert Redford’s passing broke, cinema paused. It felt as
    though a curtain had fallen too soon, closing an era. Redford was more than
    an actor or director; he was a cultural lion — a builder of bridges, a
    guardian of truth, and a man whose roar lived not in volume but in
    conviction.
  </p>

  <!-- Section: The Lion of Cinema -->
  <h3 class="layout-title">The Lion of Cinema</h3>
  <p>
    From <em>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</em> to <em>The Sting</em>,
    Redford charmed audiences worldwide. Yet he never settled for being
    Hollywood’s golden face. His directorial work in
    <em>Ordinary People</em> won the Academy Award for Best Director, not for
    glamour but for its unflinching honesty. He gave audiences a mirror to face
    their own fractures and silences.

  <!-- Section: Sundance Legacy -->
  <h3 class="layout-title">Sundance and the Voices of Tomorrow</h3>
  <p>
    In 1981, Redford founded the Sundance Institute, answering a question no one
    had asked: Where could rejected, daring stories find a home? Sundance became
    a sanctuary for outsiders and dreamers. From Quentin Tarantino to Ava
    DuVernay and Ryan Coogler, many of today’s visionary filmmakers walked
    through doors Redford built.
  </p>

  <!-- Section: The Activist -->
  <h3 class="layout-title">The Activist’s Roar</h3>
  <p>
    Redford’s roar extended beyond the screen. Decades before climate change
    dominated headlines, he raised his voice for the environment, lobbying
    leaders and funding documentaries. His activism was inconvenient, often
    unpopular — yet unwavering. He lived his belief that art and conscience were
    inseparable.

      Beyond the screen, Redford championed environmental causes with quiet
      strength.

  <!-- Section: Tributes -->
  <h3 class="layout-title">Tributes from the World</h3>
  <p>
    Meryl Streep called him a man of “quiet integrity whose roar was his art.”
    Jane Fonda remembered him as a partner in craft and conscience. Brad Pitt
    described him as “a north star for risk-takers.” The Sundance Institute
    declared:
    <em
      >“Sundance exists because Redford believed storytelling could change the
      world.”</em
    >
  </p>

  <!-- Section: Contradictions and Humanity -->
  <h3 class="layout-title">Contradictions that Defined Him</h3>
  <p>
    Redford embodied paradoxes: matinee idol and rebel, private man and public
    activist, a symbol of permanence yet a champion of change. His authenticity
    and moral courage became his true legacy, proving that depth could thrive in
    an industry accused of being shallow.
  </p>

  <!-- Section: Enduring Legacy -->
  <h3 class="layout-title">Enduring Legacy</h3>
  <p>
    As audiences revisit <em>All the President’s Men</em>,
    <em>Ordinary People</em>, or <em>All Is Lost</em>, they relive his
    philosophy: cinema as conscience, protest, and empathy. His passing closes a
    chapter where Hollywood still had lions who walked with integrity — yet his
    echo resounds in every Sundance premiere and every artist who dares to
    believe.
  </p>

  <!-- Outro -->
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <strong>Bottom line:</strong> Robert Redford was not perfect, nor did he
      claim to be. Yet in his imperfections lay his humanity, and in his
      humanity, greatness. One of the lions has passed, but his footsteps remain
      — guiding generations to walk paths of authenticity, courage, and vision.
    </p>
